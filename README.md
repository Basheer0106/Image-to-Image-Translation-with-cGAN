# Image-to-Image-Translation-with-cGAN
This project uses a Conditional GAN (cGAN) to translate input images into corresponding output images by learning paired image mappings, enabling realistic and structure-preserving transformations.
# Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN (pix2pix)

## Overview
This project implements **image-to-image translation using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** based on the **pix2pix** architecture. The model learns a mapping from an input image to an output image using paired training data.

The approach uses a generator to produce translated images and a discriminator to evaluate their realism, enabling the model to generate high-quality and visually consistent outputs.
